        <h1>The difference between absolute and relative CSS length units.</h1>
        <p>The main difference between absolute and relative CSS length units is that absolute units do not change, while relative units are variable and increase in relation to another value.Absolute units are not relative to screen or other element sizes. They are a measurement by physical measure, i.e., inches or centimeters. This makes them stable, especially for print, but less ideal for creating responsive sites that will go on different sizes of screens.Relative units take their value from another element, such as the font size of the parent element or the size of the browser window (viewport). This flexibility is key to current responsive web design, as it allows layouts and text to adapt smoothly.</p>

        <h2>Explaining what the CSS units px & pt, em & rem and vw & vh mean.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>px (Pixel): This is the most common absolute unit in web design. One pixel (1px) is defined as 1/96th of an inch. While it's considered an absolute unit, its actual physical size on a screen can vary depending on the screen's pixel density. It's a reliable unit for precise control but doesn't scale based on user preferences (like browser font size settings), which can be an accessibility issue.</li>
            <li>pt (Point): This unit is traditionally used in print media. One point (1pt) is equal to 1/72nd of an inch. You'll often see it used in word processors for font sizes. In CSS, it's most useful when creating stylesheets specifically for printing a web page. For screen display, px, rem, or em are generally preferred.</li>
            
            <li>em: This unit is relative to the font-size of its direct parent element. For example, if a div has a font-size of 16px, and its child p has a font-size of 1.5em, the paragraph's computed font size will be 24px (16 * 1.5). This can be powerful, but it can also lead to a "compounding" effect where nested elements become unexpectedly large or small.</li>
            <li>rem (Root Em): This unit is relative to the font-size of the root element (the html element). This avoids the compounding issue of em. If the root font size is the browser default of 16px, 2rem will always compute to 32px (16 * 2), no matter how deeply the element is nested. This makes rem incredibly predictable and great for creating scalable, accessible designs that respect the user's browser settings.</li>
            
            <li>vw (Viewport Width): Represents 1% of the viewport's width. So, 50vw is equal to 50% of the browser window's current width. If you want an element to always span the entire width of the screen, you would set its width to 100vw.</li>
            <li>vh (Viewport Height): Represents 1% of the viewport's height. 100vh is equal to the full height of the browser window. This is very popular for creating full-screen "hero" sections on a webpage, where an image or a block of content takes up the entire visible screen when the page first loads.</li>
